Hi! I’m _James McEwan_, a developer from Scotland. I mainly work
with JavaScript to build useful apps that are (hopefully) fun too!

I code over on [github](https://github.com/jamesmcewan) / [mcwn.dev](https://mcwn.dev), you
can check out my drawings on [mcewan.ink](https://mcewan.ink) and I’m usually reachable via
[twitter](https://twitter.com/mce).
