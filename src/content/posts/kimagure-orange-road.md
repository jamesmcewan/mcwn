First in a series of favourite anime themes. [Kimagure Orange Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimagure_Orange_Road) has a quintisentially 80s theme that I've been singing all day.

This 1987 show is based on a Weekly Shonen Jump manga series that ran from 1984 to 1987. It's a fun romatic comedy series with a supernatural theme, Ky≈çsuke Kasuga is a lad with super powers that finds himself in a new town and immediately in the middle of a love triangle with his new classmates Madoka Ayukawa and Hikaru Hiyama.
