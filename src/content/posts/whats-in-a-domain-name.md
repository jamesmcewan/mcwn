I've never been great at naming things. Over the years I've collected many a handle, domain name, and project code name.

Normally it's something pithy, that dates terribly, and I end up hating it within a few weeks, but I can never come up with something better, other times it's accidentally lewd and I just haven't noticed the double entendre.

## Role call

Here's a list of some of the names I've used over the years:

- Speedforce2099 - first name I used online mixing the Flash with Marvel 2099. Fun fact, I misspelled Speedforce as Speedfoce.
- GenMutant - more Marvel, was a big Generation X fan.
- Jono Atomic - Again, Generation X, this time Chamber, I was also getting into Madaman so Atomic was a bit of a nod to that.
- neomac - THE MATRIX.
