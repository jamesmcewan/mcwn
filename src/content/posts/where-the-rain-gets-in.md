It's been around a decade since I last had a blog. I started to miss having a corner of the web that was somewhat obscure and just for me.

Domain names, social media, they're all very... loud. I'm not really that kind of person. I much prefer the chorus to the spotlight.

So right now, that's that this is, my corner to share things with a smaller group of people. Maybe I'll password protect this, or more likely delist it, if you know, you know.
