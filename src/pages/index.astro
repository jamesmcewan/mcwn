    # Hi! I’m _James McEwan_, a Senior Engineer.

    I love building things for the web, with a passion for performant, accessible apps, JavaScript, CSS, and all the Jamstack goodness.

    I'm also avid fan of comic books, coffee, mechanical keyboards, backpacks, and stationary. In my spare time I enjoy illustrating using either traditional mediums or digitally on my iPad Pro.

    ## Where to find me

    I usually tinker with [these apps](https://apps.mcwn.dev) over on [github](https://github.com/jamesmcewan), occasionally I put some drawings up on [my portfolio](https://draws.mcwn.dev).

    I’m usually reachable via [@mce on twitter](https://twitter.com/mce) and always happy to help with any code problems or talk about any of the above interests!
