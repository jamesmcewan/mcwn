# Hi! Iâ€™m James McEwan, a creative tech & cartoonist.

I love building things for the web, with a passion for performant, accessible apps, JavaScript, CSS, and all the Jamstack goodness.

I'm also avid fan of comic books, coffee, mechanical keyboards, backpacks, and stationary. In my spare time I enjoy illustrating using either traditional mediums or digitally on my iPad Pro.

## Where to find my work

Occasionally, I put some drawings up on [my portfolio](https://mcewan.ink). I also put together this [MVL app](https://mvl.mcwn.dev) to track the new Marvel comics releases each week - the code for this and other things I've built is over on [github](https://github.com/jamesmcewan).
