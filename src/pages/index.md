# Hi! I’m James McEwan, a creative tech & cartoonist.

I love building things for the web, with a passion for performant, accessible apps, JavaScript, CSS, and all the Jamstack goodness.

I'm also avid fan of comic books, coffee, mechanical keyboards, backpacks, and stationary. In my spare time I enjoy illustrating using either traditional mediums or digitally on my iPad Pro.

## Where to find me

I usually tinker with [these apps](https://apps.mcwn.dev) over on [github](https://github.com/jamesmcewan), occasionally I put some drawings up on [my portfolio](https://mcewan.ink).

I’m usually reachable via [@mce on twitter](https://twitter.com/mce) and always happy to help with any code problems or talk about any of the above interests!
