# James McEwan still hasn’t decided what he wants to be when he grows up.

In the meantime he’s a developer, a designer, an illustrator, a photographer, a hardware hacker, a collector, and whatever else happens to take his fancy.

His work can be found on [github](https://github.com/jamesmcewan), or on his [portfolio](https://mcwn.ink). He is reachable on <a rel="me" href="https://social.lol/@mcwn">mastodon</a>.
